# couchPie 🛋️🥧

**Smart TV killer. Portable media hub. Pi-powered freedom machine.**

couchPie turns your Raspberry Pi 4/5 into a fully-customizable entertainment center that:

* Streams games from your PC using [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) and [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/)
* Plays media files from your PC over the network via SMB
* Launches Netflix, Prime Video, HBO Max, and more using Chromium in kiosk mode
* Boots directly into [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) with custom app shortcuts
* Supports CEC for your TV remote
* Runs fully offline OR remotely with [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) for secure remote access
* Integrates with Alexa using the Manual Smart Home Skill and Home Assistant (Stage 3)
* Can be taken anywhere, broadcast its own Wi-Fi, and act like a portable smart TV system
